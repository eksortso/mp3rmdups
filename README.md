# mp3-rm-dups
Tools to remove duplicate MP3 files generated by the Google Music Manager.

This project has been archived, since I no longer need it. If you need a
deduplicator, it may just be worth finding the `fdupes` tool and using that
instead, since to date, this program just does what `fdupes -dN` does, as far as
I can tell.
